🌍 What is Equinomix?
Equinomix is an open coordination protocol designed to embed real-world execution behavior into smart contracts, access control, and financial flows. It enables statistically verified cooperation across physical and digital actors — without relying on opaque AI models or manual enforcement.

Originally piloted in the transportation sector, the protocol is domain-agnostic and can be adapted to any execution-driven economy: logistics, energy, insurance, digital public infrastructure.

“No trust without trace. No access without behavior.”

⚙️ Core Innovation
The protocol introduces a protected coordination kernel and modular infrastructure that includes:

✅ Normality Corridor
✅ Coaching & Responsiveness Evaluation
✅ Smart Contract Access Layer
✅ Composite NFTs
✅ Meta-Evaluation Layer
✅ Architectural Rent Model
All logic is on-chain verifiable, compatible with ESG/SDG alignment, and optimized for public-private coordination.

🧠 Why It Matters
Legacy ERP and scoring systems fail to track real-time execution or enforce behavior-based access. Equinomix enables measurable trust between banks, regulators, operators, and users.

🔐 Patent Status
